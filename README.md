# Assignment
## Directions
1. Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.
2. Add 0.025 to the extracted float value to account for margin of error
3. Print the Adjusted DSPAM Confidence Score

## Starter Code
```python
    str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
```

## Expected Output
```
Adjusted DSPAM Confidence Score: 0.8725
```

## Test
When you think your code is finished, run `pytest` in the terminal!
